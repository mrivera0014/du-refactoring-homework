# du-week-1-refactoring-homework

In this repository I have refactored a marketing agency's html code. In addition, I went through and consolidated and organized the css code.I did this project because it helped me understand the importance of using semantic elements and keeping your code organized.

I also did this because when using semantic codes it helps with search engine optimization.

Inside the html code I went through and updated the following div tags to current semantic elements; header, main, a, section, aside, and footer. The images also needed alt tags added so I went through and added those to the six images provided within the html code. Lastly, one of the links was not working when pressed, turns out it was missing its "id" so that was fixed.

As far as the css code, I didn't make any changes. What I did do was go through and group classes that had the same changes being done. Besides consolidating some sections of code I reorganized the css code so the classes and elements are in the same order for both files.

The consolidation part was difficult for me because I missed some parts such as ".search-engine-optimization img" vs ".search-engine-optimization." What was worse is that I didn't refresh my page every time I consolidated sections so when I was finished I noticed stuff had shifted. This lead to me having to go back and redo my work but constantly refreshing the second time around.

This project with no doubt taught me a few things that will help me with future projects.
